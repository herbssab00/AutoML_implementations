# Automated Machine Learning

This project contains implementations and tests with automated machine learning algorithms.

## Hyperband
The hyperband algorithm was proposed by Li et al. in 2017 and makes use of Successive Halfing to find an optimal model and
hyper-parameters. For further information please refer to the original paper in [1].

I used four different regression models (KNN, SVR, RF, Lasso) to implement the algorithm. In practice, this can be extended 
with other models and also for classification tasks.

### Files
- [Hyperband.py](hyperband/hyperband.py): contains the implementation of the hyperband algorithm
    - `hyperband_algorithm`: this function that needs to be called and is reponsible for the actual execution of the algorithm
    - `get_hyperparameter_configurations`: this function returns **n** models and hyper-parameter configurations
    - `run_then_return_val_loss`: the function fits a given model and returns the loss on an independent test set
    - `top_k`: returns the **k** best configurations
- [main.py](hyperband/main.py): runs the hyperband algorithm for a given dataset
